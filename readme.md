This is work in progress

This project will enable the database migration tool [grate](https://erikbra.github.io/grate/) to be used as an addin in [Cake](https://cakebuild.net). 

This addin will be backwards compatible with the existing [RoundhousE](https://cakebuild.net/dsl/roundhouse/) aliases where the tool grate is backwards compatible with RoundhousE. For details see the grate guide to [Migrating from RoundHouse](https://erikbra.github.io/grate/migrating-from-roundhouse/).
